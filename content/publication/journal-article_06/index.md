abstract: We report the experimental observation of speeded-up collective motion of the monolayer endothelia-cancer mixture on a collagen-coated substrate, after the invasion of a small fraction of motile cancer cells into the confluent endothelial monolayer, through disrupting cell-cell junctions. It is found that, with an increasing waiting time, the cancer-free confluent endothelial monolayer exhibits a dynamical slowing-down of liquidlike micromotion with a gradually decreasing degree of superdiffusion. After invasion, cancer cells aggregate and exhibit turbulentlike cooperative motion, which is enhanced with the increasing size of gradually aggregated cancer clusters, confined by the fluctuating boundaries of surrounding endothelial cells. It, in turn, enhances the surrounding endothelial cell motion and speeds up the originally slowed-down motion.
