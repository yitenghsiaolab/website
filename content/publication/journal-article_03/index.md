abstract: Interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy is a highly sensitive imaging technique that uses common-path interferometry to detect the linear scattering fields associated with samples. However, when measuring a complex sample, such as a biological cell, the superposition of the scattering signals from various sources, particularly those along the optical axis of the microscope objective, considerably complicates the data interpretation. Herein, we demonstrate high-speed, wide-field iSCAT microscopy in conjunction with confocal optical sectioning. Utilizing the multibeam scanning strategy of spinning disk confocal microscopy, our iSCAT confocal microscope acquires images at a rate of 1,000 frames per second (fps). The configurations of the spinning disk and the background correction procedures are described. The iSCAT confocal microscope is highly sensitiveâ€”individual 10 nm gold nanoparticles are successfully detected. Using high-speed iSCAT confocal imaging, we captured the rapid movements of single nanoparticles on the model membrane and single native vesicles in the living cells. Label-free iSCAT confocal imaging enables the detailed visualization of nanoscopic cell dynamics in their most native forms. This holds promise to unveil cell activities that are previously undescribed by fluorescence-based microscopy.
