abstract: Chromatin organization and dynamics play important roles in governing the regulation of nuclear processes of biological cells. However, due to the constant diffusive motion of chromatin, examining chromatin nanostructures in living cells has been challenging. In this study, we introduce interferometric scattering correlation spectroscopy (iSCORS) to spatially map nanoscopic chromatin configurations within unlabeled live cell nuclei. This label-free technique captures time-varying linear scattering signals generated by the motion of native chromatin on a millisecond timescale, allowing us to deduce chromatin condensation states. Using iSCORS imaging, we quantitatively examine chromatin dynamics over extended periods, revealing spontaneous fluctuations in chromatin condensation and heterogeneous compaction levels in interphase cells, independent of cell phases. Moreover, we observe changes in iSCORS signals of chromatin upon transcription inhibition, indicating that iSCORS can probe nanoscopic chromatin structures and dynamics associated with transcriptional activities. Our scattering-based optical microscopy, which does not require labeling, serves as a powerful tool for visualizing dynamic chromatin nano-arrangements in live cells. This advancement holds promise for studying chromatin remodeling in various crucial cellular processes, such as stem cell differentiation, mechanotransduction, and DNA repair.
